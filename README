I. Adding the layers/meta-alexa layer to your build
=================================================

Run 'bitbake-layers add-layer layers/meta-alexa'. In most cases
building the container yourself is unnecessary, pulling the prebuilt
container from a container registry is the preferred approach.


II. Alexa Skill Definition
==========================

You must first ensure you are registered as an Alexa Developer
(https://developer.amazon.com/) and are familiar with the Alexa Skills
Kit before you continue.

In order to make use of the overc-seer-hub you must define an Alexa
skill in the Alexa developer console.

1)  From the Alexa console select "Create Skill"
2)  Enter a skill name "Pulsar"
3)  Select "Next"
4)  Select the "Custom" for the model type
5)  Select "Create Skill"
6)  Select "Invocation" (this is what is said to open your skill)
7)  Enter "Pulsar" or whatever one or two words you want
8)  Select the "JSON Editor"
9)  Cut and paste the contents of skill.json in the editor
10) Select "Endpoint"
11) Select "HTTPS"
12) Fill in your endpoint details for the "Default Region"
13) Build your skill


II. Misc
========

The 'overc-seer-hub' and 'pot-watcher' containers must be configured
properly before use, please review their respective README files for
specific details for each of these containers.
